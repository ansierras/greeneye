This project was part of an Information Visualization course I took at KTH (Royal Institute of Technology) in Sweden. 

As part of an energy consumption awareness campaign, Fortum - an energy providing company in Sweden - contacted the school and provided us with information of energy and water consumption for several days in a pilot appartment in a high class neighborhood in Stockholm. 
For the project we had to take the information provided - a very long CSV file - and make sense of it. 
Our professor asked us to create an information visualization that would run in a tablet, so that users could hang them on their walls like it was a changing piece of art. 
For inspiration purposes, he asked us to look at a famous visualization project called Flickr Flow, by Fernanda Viegas (http://hint.fm/projects/flickr/).

For this we could use any tool we wanted, but d3.js was recommended. Which is why I decided to use this library to create my project.
